Testing & Quality Tools
QpLite Program
The QpLite is a simple and mobile crimp force monitoring device that captures quality based on crimp force curves on tabletop crimpers.
The QpLiteâ€™s simple touch display allows for intuitive operation. 

The user is guided through the quality validation including measurement of the crimp height, 
crimp width and pull-out force. The validated data is automatically stored in the database.
The QpLite can be used with the Ethernet network adapter
with other quality tools. Material testing with the barcode scanner is therefore possible as an option.
The scanned data is compared with the QpNet database and the process is blocked if the materials do not comply with the specifications.
This also helps to avoid production errors. The device can be upgraded with additional software licenses without upgrading the hardware.
